<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>
This list has been compiled to answer questions about Matt
Wagner's Grendel that have been asked in the rec.arts.comics newsgroups.  As a
long time Grendel-phile, it's been a pleasure to construct this list, and to
try to answer some of the questions of who and what Grendel is.  I'm not sure
of the all the answers myself.  To that end I'm always open to comments
corrections.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that this list covers only Matt Wagner Grendel
appearances.  All non-Wagner Grendels will be included in the Bibliography
section, but not in the history section as the "Grendel Tales" stories add
little to the chronology and can be treated as separate entities.  They will
only be mentioned where appropriate.</p>

<p>Thanks you, and, as always...</p>
 
  <h4>VIVAT GRENDEL!</h4>

<p>- Jeremy Holstein</p>

<p>As of the last few years I've hosted this FAQ (which was previously only posted in the rec.arts.comics list in text form) so as to maintain the information. In 17 odd years things have gotten out of date or changed. I've kept it up to date in places but left a lot of the original content for posterity. I keep meaning to update it with the more recent releases (an excellent Grendel omnibus series has been released this year for example) and continue to fill in the gaps in back-issues, stories and other items but time is never on my side.</p>

<h3><a name="1">01: What is Grendel?</a></h3>

<p>Grendel is a comic created by Matt Wagner.  Under the Grendel title,
Wagner has published some 60 odd stories about the character.  The book is
highly experimental in terms of story-telling, but under Wagner's guidance has
still managed to maintain a consistent quality.  Wagner, a somewhat sporadic
creator, has done his most work with the Grendel character to date.</p>

<p>Currently the series is continuing under the banner "Grendel Tales" with
little to no direct involvement by Wagner.  However several Wagner reprints
have been issued by Dark Horse, and most feature new Wagner covers.</p>

<p>See <a href="#5">Section 05: Who is Matt Wagner?</a></p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="2">02: Who is Grendel?</a></h3>

<p>This is a far more difficult question to answer than 01, for there have been
MANY Grendels throughout the history of the title (see 03).  But all the
Grendels to date have at least two things in common:</p>

<p>1)	All the Grendels have worn the same mask, or a variation thereof.  The
mask is black with two large white oval eyes, and a small white circle
over the nose.  Running perpendicular through the ovals are two spear
shapes which run the height of a head.  The mask is generally attached via
a set of straps, tied at the base of the skull.  Later versions of the
mask have dropped the circle, relying far more on the oval/spear shape
displayed over top the wearer's eyes.</p>

<p>2)	All of the Grendels have been refereed to by Wagner as "The
Spirit of Aggression."  Despite some argument as to whether this applies
to the current situation of a Grendel in the current story line, to date
all Grendels have certainly been portrayed as aggressive people.</p>

<p>In addition, the majority of the Grendels to date have used a weapon
refereed to as a "Fork".  The weapon appears as a staff, with twin
parallel blades perched upon one end.  Many variations of the weapon have
appeared in the title.</p>

<p>Since the "Tales" series began, Grendel has now taken on a more
ritualistic and military style of identity.  A Grendel is a position of
honour which few can obtain.  However the above two rules still apply to
all the central protagonists.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="3">03: Can you provide me with some history for the character?</a></h3>

<p>The following is a history of the character which was originally printed as
a back up for the War Child series.  A summary of War Child has been included.
It should be noted that since War Child has ended several "Grendel Tales"
series have appeared, but as very few of them are interconnected I have chosen
to exclude these stories for now.  It should also be noted that while this will
give you a history to enjoy Grendel in the present, it is in no means a
substitute for the original comics, recommended reading all.   These summaries
are bare bones outlines of some very complex story lines, and they cover over
500 years of continuity.  Many details and events have been excluded for the
sake of brevity.</p>

<h4>THE LONG AND TWISTED HISTORY OF GRENDEL</h4>

<h5>Part 1: Hunter Rose</h5>

<h5>THE PRODIGY</h5>

<p>Somewhere in the latter part of the twentieth century,  in an ordinary
midwestern town, to a pair of very ordinary parents, there was born an
extra-extraordinary child whose true name is known to us now only as Eddie. A
genius of immeasurable depth, Eddie excelled at his every form of endeavour. At
the tender age of four, he had memorised his own local phone book as well as
that of the surrounding half-dozen counties. By six he could quote any line of
Shakespeare, and by eight he had written over a dozen plays and fifty short
stories, and was working on drafts for several different (apparently
unfinished) novels at once.

<p>Unfortunately for both Eddie and the world, neither his parents nor his
pedestrian teachers took much notice of his young achievements, and so the lad
was nurtured solely on boredom. Initially Eddie found release from his
frustrations in the world of competitive sports, but here, too, he overachieved
and soon found himself competing at an international level on the fencing
strip. True to form, Eddie took his zeal to the tournament finals, only to
secretly throw the match in an agonising denial of how very easy it all had
been. It was at this point that Eddie met the woman who would be the most
influential person in his young and tragically brutal life.

<p>Jocasta Rose was a trainer for the British fencing team; she found herself
fascinated with the daring young prodigy who, she was sure, had just
deliberately relinquished his claim to the world championship. A hot-blooded
iconoclast herself, Jackie confronted Eddie after the match and swept him off
his tired and lonely feet into a world of glorious sensation and romance.  Over
the space of the next year- which would prove to be the rest of Jocasta Rose's
life - she and Eddie never parted company again. A terminal illness killed her
less than thirteen months after they first met.

<h5>THE ASSASSIN</h5>

<p>The death of his lover devastated the young genius, but her fiery spirit
lingered in his soul.  His will to fight and achieve was twisted by twisted his
grief into a monstrous and insatiable ideal.  Returning incognito to the
States, he adopted the name of Hunter Rose and soon wrote several best sellers,
taking the literary world by storm at the age of seventeen. But,  still, there
remained an empty fury in Hunter Rose's heart. The need to achieve became the
lust to control, and so another alias to an already fractured personality was
born. The crime families of Manhattan were soon confronted with a presence even
deadlier and more , heartless than their own. The name of the masked assassin
Grendel was spoken only in whispers, and many a seasoned killer prayed to avoid
running afoul of whoever held Grendel's contractual reins of the moment.  In
less than two years, Grendel had moved into a position of power over one of the
major families, and he soon consolidated his realm to include most of the
criminal activities within the entire metropolitan area. Once again, he had won
easily over seemingly insurmountable odds. But where was the challenge that
would unseat him, the battle he could never win, the heart of fire that would
rival his own?

<h5>THE CHILD AND THE WOLF</h5>

<p>In fact, it was early in his nefarious career that Grendel first encountered
the two lives that would ultimately prove to be the undoing of his own. The
adopted niece of a crooked real-estate mogul, Stacy Palumbo captured what
little empathy still existed in Hunter Rose's icy heart by her unnatural
resemblance to his first love. Following the death of her uncle at Grendel's
hand, Stacy came to live with Hunter as his legal ward.  Ironically, the only
other friend to this lonely child was Grendel's greatest enemy, Argent, the
mysterious wolf. In Stacy, Hunter saw the potential and innocence that might
have been his own lot, and, in Argent, he found the fury and power that were
indeed his fate. This pathetic triangle was destined for tragedy, of course,
and Stacy's discovery of her mentor's true identity precipitated the climax.
Grendel and Argent met in a final, ferocious battle that left the wolf broken
and withdrawn, and proved to be the ultimate doom for the man the world had
known as Hunter Rose.

<h5>THE LEGACY</h5>

<p>Stacy Palumbo spent the rest of her days in an institution. She was briefly
released around the age of twenty-five to marry her analyst, but, here again,
tragedy clouded her young, hopeless life. The wedding night became a
rape/suicide, the result of which was the birth of Stacy's only daughter,
Christine, who was soon given up for adoption. Following this, the tortured
stepdaughter of Grendel lapsed into a stupor that lasted the rest of her days.
Christine would never know her real mother until, years later, she interviewed
Stacy for a book she was writing on the life of Grendel: Devil by the Deed.

<p>The Wolf went into seclusion and was rarely seen in public again.

<h5>Part 2: Christine Spar</h5>

<h5>A MOTHER IN PAIN</h5>

<p>The daughter of Hunter Rose's adopted ward Stacy, Christine Powell spent her
entire life trying to shake off the ugly vestiges of a legacy she never really
knew. Even the untimely death of her husband, war correspondent Peter Spar,
served only to remind her of the bloody heritage thrust upon her not only by
the world at large but, indeed, by her very lineage. Finally, Christine decided
to exorcise these inner demons by undertaking an in-depth examination of the
man whom her mother had actually ~ succeeded in killing. ' This investigation
served instead to awaken in her an even deeper fascination for the man known as
Grendel, and the result was the now infamous book Devil by the Deed.  It was
shortly after the advent of her new-found notoriety as an '-. author that
Christine and her young son Anson attended a kabuki theatre performance at
Radio City Music Hall. At first, Christine found herself entranced with the
star dancer, Tujiro XIV, but in a subsequent backstage meeting she was soon
repulsed by his boldly lascivious manner. As she tucked Anson into bed later
that night, little did Christine suspect that this would be the last time she
would ever see her only son alive.

<h5>A NIGHTMARE IN DISGUISE</h5>

<p>When police investigations yielded nothing on Anson's disappearance, Christine
took up the chase herself and soon made a startling discovery: a trail of
disappearances, all of young boys and all coinciding with the nation-wide tour
schedule of Tujiro's kabuki troupe. Grief-stricken, but focused with a cold and
unreasoning hatred, Christine set about the task either of rescuing or of
revenging her missing child. Knowing this would take her into a realm outside
the law, Christine resolved to disguise herself behind a persona that literally
embodied the contemptuous emotions in which she was slowly drowning. Stealing
the original mask and fork of Hunter Rose, she set off for the west coast and
the spirit of Grendel was thus born again. In San Francisco, she eventually
caught up with the travelling show and began a cover espionage of her suspect,
which soon revealed even more shocking facts. Tujiro was, in fact, a vampire
who not only displayed a marked taste for young boys but also doubled as the
head of an international slavery ring. It was here that Christine Spar's trail
of vengeance hit an unexpected snag. Throughout her  intricate hunt for the
monster, Tujiro, she had, found herself becoming involved with the stage
manager of the kabuki theatre's latest venue, Brian Li Sung. When Christine
discovered that Tujiro intended to kidnap Brian to serve as the latest slave in
his insidious schemes, her rage finally exploded and the stage was set for the
final confrontation.  After a fierce and bloody battle that failed to bag her
intended prey but did succeed in breaking the vampire's ring of power,
Christine was forced to flee both the city on the bay and the gentle young man
she had so quickly come to love.

<h5>A MONSTER IN HIDING</h5>

<p>Although she did her best to leave both the persona and her actions as Grendel
behind, Christine soon found herself swept along in the hatred and fear that
had marked the life of her predecessor. Back in New York, she was immediately
hounded by both the police and Grendel's original nemesis, Argent the wolf.
When Brian Li Sung followed her back to the east coast, he soon fell victim to
this police brutality, and Christine finally gave herself over to the
overwhelming anger of Grendel. In a battle that seemed written by the cruel
hand of destiny, she finally met her end at the hands of the vicious Argent but
not before she succeeded in killing the monstrous wolf as well. The legacy of
Grendel, it seems, had at last seen its end or had it?

<h5>Part 3: Brian Li Sung</h5>

<h5>INNOCENCE ADRIFT</h5>

<p>The death of Christine Spar left another, all-but-unnoticed casualty in its
bloody wake, the bruised and tortured spirit of her young lover, Brian.  Firm
in his blind ambition to steer Chris from her seemingly fated path, Brian had
no idea how this vortex of violence would eventually prove too much for his own
fragile soul as well. His tragic catharsis first began at the very moment of
Christine's  death as Grendel.  It was only later that Brian began to realise
the full extent of her isolated madness and lonely certainty that she passed
onto him in the form of Grendel's logs. These copious journals which included
not only those volumes stolen by her mother, Stacy, from the original fiend,
Hunter Rose, but also Christine's own account of her life as Grendel were
secretly buried by their jealous owner in the unmarked wilds of Central Park.
Nestled under the pillows of the same bed in which he and Chris had shared
their last moments together, Brian discovered both a map and the key to this
strongbox containing the festering memoirs of demons.

<p>Unable to leave these infamous relics behind, Brian was also quite sure the
encroaching eyes of the police would never allow him to smuggle the journals
out of New York either. He soon found himself taking a low-paying job
off-Broadway as well as making do with dreadful living conditions all to ensure
that he might spend his evenings slowly drowning in the lives of two people
possessed by violence.

<h5>SUBSISTENT RAGE</h5>

<p>Lost not only in the past, but also in the harsh, day-to-day existence of New
York, Brian soon found himself victim to all the pent-up anger and frustration
revealed in the pages of his newly sacred texts. A recovered alcoholic, Brian
desperately began drinking again. He experienced memory losses as well as
outbursts of temper and even started keeping secret journals himself.
Eventually, he became convinced he had actually encountered Christine's ghost
in the seedy confines of the theatre he managed. In an effort to once again
call forth his lover's spirit, he finally donned a crude Grendel mask which he
had fashioned to act as a talisman.  Although the apparition never
materialised, its presence was felt when Brian, still masked, viciously
battered a security guard who had interrupted the ritual. Although outwardly
sickened by this startling change in his demeanour, internally Brian continued
to nurture his growing rage. The evolution of Brian's violence finally peaked
with the killing of a would-be assailant in Central Park. In his obsessive zeal
to know and understand Grendel he had in fact become the fiend. Continually
hounded by the flamboyant Captain Wiggins of the New York Police, Brian then
began to perceive his condition as an actual possession. The spirit of Grendel
had somehow burrowed its way into his soul and there it gestated, a diabolic
consciousness that cared naught for anyone most especially the hapless host
body it so viciously toyed with.

<h5>TERMINAL EVICTION</h5>

<p>The final stage in Brian's madness came when his delusions focused on the
person of Captain Wiggins. Convinced that Wiggins was keen to the truth of his
masked excursions, "Grendel" next decided to stalk and eliminate the
troublesome cop. Here Brian's tragic downslide reached its conclusion but not
without a final moment of redemption. Bound by the demon's desires to hunt down
his persecutor, Brian nevertheless strove to break what he saw as Grendel's
control over his body and mind. Unable to resist, he trailed the detective over
the course of an evening until his path eventually led to Central Park and the
site of Brian's one and only act of murder.  In these last moments of
confrontation, Brian fought an internal battle for the sake of his very soul.
His defiance finally triumphed, as Brian barely managed to stay his own attack
by a crucial fraction of a second all the time necessary for Captain Wiggins to
turn and shot this latest Grendel dead.

<h5>Part 4: The Incubation Years</h5>

<h5>A PERSONAL NIGHTMARE</h5>

<p>With the death of Brian Li Sung, the force he had perceived as a conscious,
aggressive entity went into an extended period of apparent remission. It was to
be almost five hundred years before another singular incarnation of Grendel
would walk the earth again. This is not to say that Grendel had no effect
during this time. Far from it. In fact, human civilisation continued to feel
the weight of Grendel's rage -- but in a far more subtle and, in the long run,
insidious manner. 

<p>As the one surviving person to have been directly involved with the succession
of criminals known as Grendel, Captain Albert Wiggins suddenly found himself
having an unexpected celebrity status. Eventually, he left COP (Confederacy of
Police) to retire in the tropics and spin out a series of best-selling tales
about Hunter Rose, the only Grendel Wiggins had never actually met. With this
success came all the trappings of luxury as well as all the pressures of
wealth.  It was later in life and in his new career that Albert Wiggins finally
began to go mad. Spurred on by an apparent malfunction in his prosthetic eye,
Wiggins began seeing the world around him as distorted and grotesque. Fans,
publishers, agents, even his doctor took on a hideous demeanour behind the
waves of Wiggins' dementia. Finally, his sense of reality lost, Wiggins
succumbed to his own inner rage and stabbed his nagging young wife to death.
Grendel, it seemed, had managed to strike again. 

<h5>A CORPORATE WEAPON</h5>

<p>A century passed before the presence of Grendel would be so directly felt
again.  In that time, the power of civil government had dwindled.
Mega-corporations now controlled most everything, and the biggest of these was
Omni Broadcasting and Entertainment Systems (OBES). At the head of the board of
directors sat Charles Dore', a rather complacent executive who nonetheless saw
Omni's bevy of Grendel entertainment products as an effective tool for
spreading into an even wider world market. At the opposing end of Omni's
management sat Harold White. While Charles Dore' strove for constant expansion,
Harold's schemes were entirely directed towards eliminating competition. Harold
deemed the world's civil governments to be both obsolete and deserving of
nothing less than absolute destruction. In the end, this doubled-edged greed
led from mistrust to misconception to tragic global mishap. The result was the
world's first extended nuclear conflict, the near eradication of the
mid-eastern OPEC nations, and the total contamination of a major portion of the
world's crude oil supply. From within the very core of the system itself,
Grendel had struck again. 

<h5>A RITUAL PENANCE</h5>

<p>The resulting social upheaval caused by this environmental tragedy affected
life on earth as had no other event in over a millennium. the world's major
power supply had been severely crippled, and, finally, the people of earth were
forced to adopt alternative sources of energy. Many methods were developed but
none more successfully than solar power. In a world now even more dependent on
the sun, life in the uppermost northern hemisphere soon became undesirable. In
a mass exodus unlike anything seen before or since, the world populace began
slowly to situate itself closer to the equator. In America, the United States
now became the United Californian Systems of America, and the already crumbling
east-coast megapolis soon became an immense ghost town of concrete and steel. A
few savage tribes/gangs continued to linger in the ruins, constantly fighting
amongst themselves for control of the few oil storage tanks that still retained
some usable sludge in their depths. One of these clans, the Forx, adopted the
figure of Grendel as their totem. They believed that the oil should be torched
rather than be put to any use whatsoever -- a nihilistic penance for what they
saw as man's never-ending aggression. Grendel, at last, had gained a welcome
foothold in the psyche of a race -- as opposed to that of an individual. 

<h5>A SOCIETAL ARCHETYPE</h5>

<p>Several hundred years passed before the world again took on some semblance of a
civilised structure. The rising new world order was mishmash of opportunistic
religion, obsessive personal indulgence, and the slogging advances of a
technology not yet sure of itself. The battle for control of the fading
American Empire was fought in the church pew as well as in the boardrooms, and,
perhaps most importantly, in the chemical-swilling minds of the public at
large. Drugs were big business in this world of the future, and corporations
strove incessantly for that elusive stimulant mixture that would provide the
greatest euphoria with the fewest side effects. It was these zealous
experiments that culminated in a heinous accident, which unleashed a new and
dangerous drug on an already imbalanced populace. This drug, whose laboratory
designation was Arcana-Prime, ultimately became known by the infamous term that
the Church itself had even adopted to replace the more antiquated name of
"Satan". The kingdom of Grendel was at hand. 

<h5>Part 5: EPS Thatcher</h5>

<h5>THE CHURCH OF LIVING DECEPTION</h5>

<p>Another period of darkness had settled over the globe. Following WWIII there
came the great migrations, as the world of men slowly divided itself into
continents by race. In the face of all this social upheaval, the Christian
church once again re-emerged as a powerful force in people's lives. Dominant
but fractured, the Church eventually also split into racial factions across the
earth.

<p>This period came to a peak under the American papacy of Innocent XLII. The
latest in a long line of despotic popes, Innocent was a media darling, a
talented manipulator of overwhelming charisma. Invoking antiquated laws of
civic funding, Pope Innocent had for years been financially pursuing the
continued growth of an immense tower in Denver, at the pinnacle of which sat
Vatican Ouest.Ouest. This outright purging of the public welfare soon aroused
the enmity of a civic-minded aristocrat, Orion Assante, the son of a
excommunicated family.  Taking the matter before America's central Board of
Directors, Orion succeeded in being appointed head of a regulatory panel known
as the Tower Commission.  Knowing full well the immense uphill struggle he had
accepted, even Orion had no way of guessing how twisted this adventure would
soon prove to be. As he settled down with his sisters/lovers to view the
televised ceremonies for the beginning of Lent, Orion was truly shocked to see
the devil himself walk the earth once again. 

<h5>THE DISCIPLE OF HISTORIC MADNESS</h5>

<p>As Innocent XLII began accepting the congregational tithes, the ceiling of St.
Elvis Cathedral exploded, and a ragged, spindly Grendel figure dropped onto the
altar of the church. There, in front of millions of viewers, this unknown devil
callously killed several worshippers before stealing the flying collection
platter and dumping the offerings into the throngs of the faithful, swarming
through the streets surrounding the Tower. What followed were a series of
terrorist attacks, each more random and bizarre than the last. This mysterious
Grendel was effectively wearing away at the public faith, and the man at the
head of that trust was furious. Innocent turned to the mercenary police squads
of COP for assistance by striking an unholy deal with their jaded leader,
Pellon Cross. Thus, while Orion continued to attack the Church in a legal
sense, Grendel proved to be the greater thorn in Innocent's side. Still, the
grand Easter mass was approaching, and for this, Innocent turned to his lackey
Pellon Cross with an even greater request. 

<h5>THE PROPHET OF TOTAL DESTRUCTION</h5>

<p>Innocent, it was soon revealed, was actually building a very special gun high
in the upper recesses of the Tower's central spire -- a weapon for which the
final component was the forbidden element plutonium. Personally challenged by
this ultimate act of thievery, Pellon Cross succeeded in securing the necessary
material -- but at the cost of his very life. After delivering the nuclear core
to his master, Pellon discovered the fateful truth behind the papal robes: that
Innocent XLII was, in fact, centuries-old vampire Tujiro XIV -- and his gun, a
device meant to eradicate the sun! 

<p>Meanwhile, Orion's own activities had in turn driven him into self-imposed
exile and had cost the lives of his treasured sisters as well. His path
eventually led him to the discovery of this latest Grendel's true identity: an
idiot/savant and societal victim name Eppy Thatcher. It was while trying to
confront this maniacal rebel that Orion encountered the confused and newly
vampire Pellon Cross. Finally realising the immensity of the situation, Orion
led a mercenary armada in a desperate attack against the Tower, as the Easter
sun broke over the Rocky Mountains. As the day's ceremony progressed, several
forces converged on the Tower: Orion and his troops; Pellon and steadily
swelling army of vampires; and Grendel himself, seeking personal battle with a
persistent and ancient foe. The resultant battle was a catastrophic, with
Orion's forces just barely managing to dynamite the Tower as the deadly Sun-Gun
was being ignited. The monster/pope was incinerated by the full force of the
blast, which then carved a path of destruction across the face of the city.
Grendel, also caught by the powerful beam, blazed out of sight in a trail of
twisted glory. As Orion surveyed the carnage from his air-cruiser, a grim
realisation came to this man who had tried for so long to fight by the rules:
there are no rules but the ones we make for ourselves. Orion could not see the
many vampire survivors far below, crawling from the wreckage to follow their
leader Pellon off into the twilight. 

<h5>Part 6: Orion Assante</h5>

<h5>A RACIAL PLAGUE</h5>

<p>Following the collapse of Vatical Tower there came a period of grand upheaval
in America. Not only was Christianity being abandoned by the masses, but now
there was an ancient and largely unknown plague to contend with. In the
confusion following the Sun-Gun catastrophe, Orion Assante emerged as a
tireless leader in the crusade to stem the tides of vampirism. As a result of
this relentless pogrom, the vampires went underground in the resort system of
VEGAS. Eventually they were contained in one of the massive casinos, which soon
became a high-security prison known as Grendel's Palace. 

<h5>A SOCIETAL ICON</h5>

<p>Shortly after his political rise to the top, Orion finally consummated his
long-standing relationship with Sherri Caniff. It was on one of her many
missions of foreign diplomacy that Sherri met the Australian psychic, Manny
McDoon.  Manny soon joined Orion's core group of advisors, his secret abilities
often giving his master the edge necessary to ensure victory in most political
arenas.  Orion's ultimate goal was a solitary global government, and through
the use of his "Orion's Sword" military fraternity, he soon managed to unite
the entire western hemisphere under his increasingly imperial rule. Fearing
both competition from Great Japan as well as rumours concerning redeveloped
nuclear technology, Orion sought to extend his influence into the eastern half
of the world as well. 

<p>A turning point was reached when a seemingly independent group of terrorists
kidnapped Sherri Caniff. With ruthless efficiency, Orion managed to rescue his
mate as well as utterly destroy her captors. The message to the world was
clear: Orion Assante would stop at nothing to achieve his goals. Only later did
he learn that the espionage was really masterminded by Great Japan. It as
during this time that Orion's growing legions of troops began to refer to
themselves as Grendels (this stemmed from an older nickname for Orion due to
his role in the collapse of the Church: "Grendel - the scourge of God"). 

<h5>A GLOBAL EMPIRE</h5>

<p>Worldwide unity was neither an easy nor inevitable goal. With various forces
opposing his efforts, Orion battled fiercely over the next decade to secure the
beginnings of his world empire. As war between the east and west became
imminent, Orion found himself besieged on all sides. He zealously struggled to
maintain control of the ground already gained. It was during this period of
incalculable stress that Sherri Caniff lost her life to cancer. Bereft at his
loss and disgusted with public life, Orion seemingly abandoned his goals and
went into seclusion along with the semiretired Manny. Finally, Orion found the
source of his meditative cure. He convinced Manny to use the last of his mental
powers to help the troubled leader locate the person who had once embodied the
madness Orion felt consuming him now - Eppy Thatcher. 

<p>Returning to public life, Orion again took up the helm of leadership as war
with Japan was just beginning. With the development of improved solar
superconductors, he was able to ensure victory at last with the creation of the
incredible Sun Disc. This flying device soon proved the the ultimate weapon as
it levelled a path of solar destruction across the Japanese archipelago. As his
last enemies sank into the sea, Orion declared himself ruler of the globe and
assumed the mantle of the first Grendel-Khan. 

<p>Unfortunately, with all his battles now won, the fight seemed suddenly to go
out of Orion. He lay down a code of ethics for his worldwide legions of troops,
but otherwise left the daily tasks of ruling to a battery of aides. In a vain
effort to produce an heir to his lonely throne, he eventually married on of his
young assistants, Laurel Kennedy. The union proved to be fruitless and,
finally, Orion made only two further contributions to world politics in his
waning years. The first was to reinstate the long dormant pogroms against all
vampires. soon driving them and their sacred-cow leader, Pellon Cross, into
exile. The other was to miraculously fulfil the purpose of his unhappy marriage
by both carrying and the bearing an heir, himself, from a
surgically-constructed male womb. Leaving the government in the hands of his
wife, Orion went into seclusion to raise his son and died quietly in his sleep
on October 17, 2588. 

<h5>Part 7: GRENDEL PRIME</h5>

<h5>A HEIR DEPARTED</h5>

<p>The rightful heir, Orion's only son Jupiter, was cloistered away in an
underground military complex deep in the Dakota Black Hills.  His political
captivity was engineered by his stepmother, then presiding regent Laurel
Assente, whose power-driven schemes make a prisoner of her own daughter
Crystal, as well.

<p>In a flurry of mysterious circumstances, Jupiter is abducted by a solitary
Grendel.  Easily bypassing the most sophisticated security the assailant left a
long and bloody trail as he sped across the continent with his precious
hostage.  Laurel frantically attempts to recover the boy before news of the
kidnapping became public.  With the help of her intelligence minister, Heath,
she made futile attempts to reaquire the heir from the Grendel known as Grendel
Prime.  To prevent further damage to her tenuous position, her daughter Crystal
is placed under a higher level of security under personal guard of a Grendel
named Susan.  Laurel becomes more and more obsessed with outwitting this
Grendel, only to find her every effort thwarted.  In her frustration she slowly
drives herself mad with power, and the treacherous Heath is able to seize power
through deception.

<h5>A TREACHEROUS JOURNEY</h5>

<p>Grendel Prime and Jupiter Assante go through a long series of treacherous
journeys to avoid capture.  They encounter Grendel troops, Mutants, Witches,
Pirates, Gorillas and (of course) Vampires, who are all dispatched quite
handily by Grendel Prime.  Eventually they are captured by a group of Rebels
who recognise Laurel and Heath's perversion of Orion's dream and are fighting
to restore honour to the throne.  Grendel Prime reveals he is a cyborg hand
picked by Orion to safeguard his son away from those who would seek him harm.
After a brutal assault by the Kahn's troops, this group of rebels fade away
with Grendel Prime and Jupiter into the mountains where they are not seen again
for ten years.

<h5>A DAUGHTER'S LONELINESS</h5>

<p>Meanwhile Crystal has formed a close relationship with her guard Sarah.  As the
two become closer Sarah's loyalties shift away from the Kahn and the Crystal
herself.  Eventually the two become lovers, and at Crystal's request Sarah
spirits her out of the military compound and away from her mother's influence.
The two escape and go into hiding, not to be seen again for the next ten years.</p>

<p>TO BE CONCLUDED</p>

<h3><a name="4">04: In what comics has Grendel appeared?</a></h3>

<p>Grendel has appeared in various titles, in various formats.  Primarily the
book was published by Comico until 1989 when bad blood and bankruptcy forced
the title's hiatus.  Grendel has now been revived with Dark Horse, and has
enjoyed a healthy relationship since. (See <a href="#9">Section 9</a> for
details).</p>

<h4>PRIMARY CANON BOOKS</h4>

MAGE 6-14 - Each issue featured a four page Grendel back up.
GRENDEL (colour) 1-40 
GRENDEL WAR CHILD 1-10
GRENDEL DEVIL'S QUEST (Grendel Tales backup series by Wagner)
    
<h4>OTHER GRENDEL BOOKS</h4>

GRENDEL (Black and White) 1-3 - One of the first wave of Comico's
publishing empire, the book was cancelled with the third issue.  But
readers liked the story line, so Wagner brought the character back as a
back-up series for Mage.  The contents of these books are summed up in the
first four pages of Devil by the  Deed.  The third issue ends with Stacy's
kidnapping ("Stacy!  She's gone!").  The art style in these issues is very
derivative of Japanese anime.  Wagner claims to be very embarrassed by
these books (and the Comico Primer) and has sworn to never reprint the
stories.  Trivia: The slogan used to promote the book was "Grendel : Evil
never looked so good.  In chilling black and white."  Note: Some price
guides insist that there was a forth issue, but I have been unable to
verify the existence of the forth.  Most price guides list only three.

GRENDEL: DEVIL'S VAGARY - a 16 page book with art by Dean Motter. Black
and White w/ Red.  This book was included with a Comico promotional item
(The Comico Collection), which also included a Grendel slipcase.  To date
it has not been reprinted.

GRENDEL: DEVIL BY THE DEED - Reprints the Mage backup series. 
The Comico edition features Matt Wagner colour
The Dark Horse edition is re-colored by Bernie Mirault.

GRENDEL: DEVIL'S LEGACY - Reprints Grendel # 1-12.  This series won
several awards (Which ones?  Help!)

GRENDEL: THE DEVIL INSIDE - Reprints Grendel #13-15.

GRENDEL TALES - The flip side to Grendel #40, this was intended as a
preview for a series which never reached fruition (see 09).  This is also
the second of the non-Wagner Grendels.  The proposed series has since been
reworked and published by Dark Horse.

BATMAN/GRENDEL- A two issue series featuring Hunter Rose and Bruce Wayne
locked in battle over Gotham City.  Issued jointly by DC and Comico, this
book was delayed some two and half years due to Comico's bankruptcy.  

GRENDEL CLASSICS #1 and 2 - Reprints Grendel #16 - 19, w/out Mage backup. 
New colouring by Bernie Mireault.

<h4>GRENDEL APPEARANCES</h4>

COMICO PRIMER 2 - A 9 page story.  This is considered to be the first
appearance of Grendel, although a picture of the character did appear in
the first issue.  This is also Wagner's first published art.

A1 BOOK 4 - A 10 page story featuring Wiggins, from Devil's Legacy and
Devil Inside.  This was intended as a preview of the original Comico
Grendel Tales, a series which never reached fruition (see 09).  This is
also the first non-Wagner Grendel to appear in print.

SILVERBACK 3 - Grendel appears for two panels, with art by Bill Loebs. 
This series chronicled the story of Argent, Grendel's Nemesis in Devil by
the Deed and Devil's Legacy. Series also includes excerpts from Wagner's
unpublished Grendel novel.

<h3><a name="7">07: Who is Argent?</a></h3>

<p>Argent is Grendel's nemesis.  Wagner stated at the beginning of the series
that he wanted to examine the shaes of gray of what is good and what is evil,
so he made his first Grendel (Hunter Rose) very suave and appealing, which the
hero was utterly despicable.  Argent thus is a very gruff, half/human half wolf
hybrid.  He claims to be a 300 year old Indian shaman who was cursed by his
tribe for a forbidden love affair.  The Silverback series portrays Argent as an
ordinary man possessed by the spirit of Masun, the spirit of death.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="8">08: Is Grendel a spirit?</a></h3>

<p>The Devil Inside seems to indicate so.  The story is told through two
narratives: Brian Li Sung's, and what seems to be Brian's sub-consciousness.
At the end of the second chapter (issue 14 of the colour series), the
sub-conscious narrative starts to refer to Brian as a "host".  This would
explain how the Grendel persona has survived over 400 years.  It would also
indicate that there might have been Grendels BEFORE Hunter Rose, and this has
been underscored by the Grendel Tales series "War Hammer", wherein a character
possessed by the spirit of Grendel rattles out a long procession of names
presumed to be past Grendels.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="9">09: Whatever happened to [insert favourite Wagner title here]?</a></h3>

<p>Wagner has a history of delayed projects, but it is not always his fault.
Many of his projects have been delayed or cancelled due to the bankruptcy of
Comico in the summer of '90.</p>

<p>The following is an inside view of the Comico collapse from Timothy Mennel,
the Managing Editor of PHILOSOPHY & PUBLIC AFFAIRS, and former submissions and
new projects editor for Comico from 1989-1990.</p>

<i><p>"The principle cause of Comico's financial woes was the news stand
distribution idea. Expanding to news stand meant adding returnable sales, which
necessitated *much* higher print runs than on direct-only titles.  The losses
mounted much more quickly than anyone realised, and this is what forced the
first Comico Implosion in 1989. (Diana Schutz told me that the expansion to
news stand required more titles and more revenue, which is why the company
picked up so many new titles in 1988--such as TROLLORDS, TROUBLE WITH GIRLS,
etc.-in an effort to find a cash cow.)</p>

<p>"Matt had always planned to end GRENDEL with issue #40, planning to replace
it with GRENDEL TALES and GRENDEL LOGS, which would be created by other writers
and artists under his supervision. The first GRENDEL TALES arc would have been
written by Matt, with Eddie Campbell drawing. This project has been abandoned
and Campbell has sold the art he did for it.  The second arc would have been
written by James Robinson. GRENDEL LOGS was to be a miniseries of entirely
black-white-and-red stories. Dark Horse periodically announces plans to do both
TALES and LOGS.</p>

<p>"Part-way through the production of the final GRENDEL arc (the Wagner/Sale
issues, #34-40), Matt changed his mind and began writing the story that became
WAR CHILD. Because he had waited so long, the book had to go on hiatus. The
important point here is that the hiatus was planned before the bankruptcy and
had nothing to do with the increasing bad blood between Matt (and Diana Schutz)
and Comico's then-publishers, Phil and Dennis LaSorda. Grendel was to break for
five months, and then return with #41.  The planned issues #41-50 were
identical to what was put out as WAR CHILD, except that the covers were to be
by John Estes (DC's STREETS), who painted three or four of them before the
bankruptcy.</p>

<p>"Comico's financial problems became critical in February 1990, the month
GRENDEL #40 came out. At this point, much of the work on #41-43 had already
been started. Comico filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but continued to meet all
of its freelancer's bills, though not always in full or on time. Nevertheless,
production on both GRENDEL and GRENDEL TALES, which was to begin simultaneously
with GRENDEL #41-, continued.</p>

<p>"Comico at this point was still distributed by DC, and so had their books
promoted in the monthly DC flier. Although relations steadily worsened between
the GRENDEL staff (Wagner, Schutz, et al.) and the Comico office, Comico
continued to promote the return of GRENDEL, both in the DC flier (see
solicitations for August 1990, e.g.), and through ads in the other Comico books
(ELEMENTALS, etc.). Comico was planning a major re-launch over the summer,
adding several new titles (including BATMAN/GRENDEL), and GRENDEL would have
been advertised in many of those titles as well. Then in May Comico ran out of
money completely.</p>

<p>"BATMAN/GRENDEL got tied up here, as Comico was supposed to pay all the
creative costs and DC all the promotional costs. Comico was unable to pay the
thousands of dollars owed Wagner, Ken Bruzenak, Joe Matt, etc.</p>

<p>"The LaSordas ceded control of the company to Andrew Rev, who over the next
few weeks fired the remaining Comico staff, leaving no contact but him for the
GRENDEL group. He claimed GRENDEL as an asset of the company, meaning that Matt
could not take it elsewhere. Matt took this as an infringement on his creative
rights (although he had signed a contract to produce GRENDEL scripts and inks
for Comico) and refused to produce work for Rev-which is understandable because
Rev is an [explicative deleted] of gargantuan proportions and took to harassing
Matt at home at all hours.  Much of the AERIALIST appears to be based on Matt's
experiences with the LaSordas and Rev."</p></i>

<p>This explains the long publication delay for Grendel, and may also affect
Mage II (although I suspect the delay on Mage is more Wagner's fault than
Rev's.)  Mage II has been promised since the summer of 1989, BEFORE the Comico
collapse, and was delayed.  Wagner has not, to my knowledge, completed any work
on the series to this date.  He has promised to FINALLY begin work upon this
project upon completion of Batman/Grendel II.</p> 

<p>The Aerialist has been delayed due to Wagner's busy schedule.  It was begun
during a lull in Wagner's career (shortly after the Comico collapse) which
since passed, leaving him little time to pursue low-paying jobs.  Dark Horse
has even gone so far as to schedule the Aerialist's return three times now,
with no success.  Wagner has stated that he will not work on the Aerialist
again until he completes his next big Batman crossover.  Currently he is
scripting DC's Sandman Mystery Theater, and is working hard on Batman/Grendel
II.</p>

<p>The oft mentioned Grendel Novel has been shelved.  In a Comics Journal
interview, Wagner states that one day he realised that he just wasn't much of a
prose author.  Selections of this manuscript saw print in the back of the
Silverback mini-series.</p>

sections from his excellent bibliography of Matt Wagner projects.  His list has
been revised and expanded  for this FAQ, and can be seen as <a
href="#6">Section 6</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="11">11: I've heard Grendel is open to submissions.  How do I submit?</a></h3>

<p>Here's Diana Schultz's answer to that question, from Grendel War
Child #6:</p>

<p><i>"A lot of readers have been bombarding me with similar requests for
information, so I'll attempt to five you the foods.  First, for those of you
who have never written or drawn comics professionally, please read what Randy
Stradley wrote regarding submissions in the back of Grendel War Child #s 2 and
3.  Then, send a self addressed stamped envelope to the Dark Horse Submissions
Editor with a request for writer's and/or artists' guidelines.  Those will tell
you what you need to know generally about hoe to submit.  Keep in mind that
your submission should be brief (4-5 pages is a good ballpark.)</p>

<p>Regarding submissions to Grendel Tales in particular, you'll need to be
thoroughly conversant with the entire Grendel story line, but all stories are
to be set in the post-Orion era.  A plot synopsis in essential; an
issue-by-issue break down is preferable.  Character sketches and sample
storytelling pages (photocopies only, please) are also necessary.  If you do
not draw then you must find an artist who is willing to work with you.  Comics
is a medium involving both words and pictures; no Grendel Tales submissions
will be considered unless they incorporate both writing and art.</p>
	
<p>Send your proposals to Matt Wagner in care of Dark Horse.  Make sure to
include your name, address and phone number.  If Matt is interested, you'll
hear from him."</p></i>

<p>HOWEVER!  BE WARNED!</p>

<p>From Grendel Classics #1:</p>

<i><p>"Matt and I have decided not to release Grendel Tales as a successively
numbered series.  However, as of 1996, we will no longer publish the series on
a monthly basis.  Rather, we plan to release one maybe two Grendel series per
year, with Matt writing at least some of the stories.  (so, with the current
backlog of Tales submissions, we really don't want any more for quite some
time)."</p></i>

<p>So the best we can say right now is if you submit to Grendel Tales you're
asking for disappointment.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="12">12: What projects are forthcoming from Matt Wagner?</a></h3>

<p>(This is current as of September, 1995)</p>

<p>Matt Wagner is currently hard at work on the sequel to Batman/Grendel II, to
be release hopefully in the first quarter of next year.</p>

<p>He is also writing a Mr. Midnight series for DC with John K. Snyder doing
the art.  Initial released sketches look great.</p>

<p>Matt has also hinted at an erotic project which may see print at some time
in the future.  Possibly as a card set!</p>

<p>Matt has stated that upon completion of Batman/Grendel II, he will begin
work upon Mage II.</p>

<p>Matt has also stated that he DOES intend to get back to the Aerialist at some
point in the future, but certainly not until after Batman/Grendel II.</p>

<p>Matt is also intending to write some new Grendel Tales books in the coming
year.</p>
